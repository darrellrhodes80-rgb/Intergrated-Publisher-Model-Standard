The Fleshed-Out Idea NFT Standard: 7 Key Criteria for Project Viability
To be considered a "fleshed-out" Idea NFT, suitable for decentralized project sourcing and collaboration, an idea should be detailed enough to answer these core questions for someone looking to understand, evaluate, or develop it:
1. The "What": Core Concept/Vision
A concise, compelling summary of the idea. What is it, at its heart?
Example: "An AI-powered app that coaches users on optimal AI interaction and allows developers to push targeted feedback tasks."
2. The "Why": Problem It Solves / Opportunity It Addresses
What pain point does this idea alleviate? What need does it fulfill? What gap in the market does it fill?
Example: "Users struggle to effectively leverage AI; developers need high-quality, targeted human feedback for AI training; both need a more intuitive feedback loop."
3. The "How" (High-Level Functionality/Features)
What are the main things it does? How does it work (at a high level)?
Example: "Generates AI-friendly prompts, collects multi-modal feedback (text, sliders), offers real-time coaching tips, gamified rewards, and aims for personalized AI style development."
4. The "Who": Target User / Market
Who is this idea for? Who would use it or benefit from it?
Example: "Individual AI users (consumers, creatives, hobbyists), AI developers (large companies, startups), and potential investors."
5. The "So What": Value Proposition
What unique value does it offer to its users or stakeholders?
Example: "Empowers users to master AI, provides developers with unparalleled training data, creates a new feedback loop for continuous AI improvement, and fosters a personalized AI experience."
6. AI's Role in Its Conception/Refinement
How was AI used to help flesh out this very idea? (This is a meta-point for the Idea NFT itself).
Example: "This idea was extensively brainstormed and refined with a conversational AI, which helped structure thoughts, identify benefits, and explore implementation details."
7. Execution Needs (for Potential Collaborators)
What kind of skills or resources would be needed to bring this idea to life?
Example: "Requires strong backend/frontend development, UI/UX design, AI/ML engineering, blockchain expertise for NFT/smart contracts, legal counsel, and potential funding."
