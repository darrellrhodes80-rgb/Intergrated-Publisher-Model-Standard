# Intergrated-Publisher-Model-Standard

A decentralized governance protocol for fair AI-human collaboration. Features vesting cliffs, clean room protection, and immutable attribution. Based on 'The Intergrated Publisher'.



The Integrated Publisher Model (IPM) Standard

A Fair Governance Protocol for the AI Era

The Problem: The "Black Box" Boss

As Artificial Intelligence begins to manage human workflows, hire freelancers, and oversee projects, we face a critical gap in infrastructure. Current smart contracts are efficient but brittle—they lack the nuance of human collaboration. They cannot distinguish between a bad actor and a bad week. They often prioritize speed over fairness, leading to "gig economy" exploitation at algorithmic speed.



The Solution: A Digital Bill of Rights

The Integrated Publisher Model (IPM) is a proposed standard for decentralized project governance. It acts as a "Constitution" for AI-human collaboration, replacing opaque "trust me" agreements with transparent, executable logic. It is designed to protect both the Project (from freeloaders) and the Contributor (from wage theft and erasure).



Core Philosophy: "Trust but Verify"

The IPM does not rely on goodwill; it relies on immutable verification. It enforces a "Glass Box" approach where revenue, contribution, and attribution are visible to all parties in real-time.



Key Mechanics:



The Vesting Cliff: Prevents "hit-and-run" contributions by requiring a minimum tenure or milestone achievement before equity is locked.



The Anchor Rule (Immutable Attribution): Ensures that a contributor's name and royalty rights cannot be "scraped off" or decoupled from their work.



The Clean Room Protocol: A "Nuclear Option" for dispute resolution—if a contributor is removed without cause, their work must be removed and rewritten from scratch, preventing intellectual property theft.



Automated "Pull" Payments: Eliminates the "check is in the mail" delay by allowing contributors to withdraw their verified share instantly.

This protocol is the technical realization of the theories presented in "The Intergrated Publisher" by Darrell Rhodes.
